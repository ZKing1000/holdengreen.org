<p>NonCompete: A few folks have said that within our current capitalist system copyright laws are needed to enable small, independent artists to make a living. While that might be technically true (I'm a full time artist myself so I really do get that), it's unfortunately a poisoned pill: anything that might protect smaller artists under capitalism will ultimately be used by large corporations to destroy smaller artists. This is why we need a radically new system where artists and scientists can truly thrive! Please watch my How Anarchism Might Work series if you're interested in these kinds of ideas, link in description :)</p>

<p>Holden Green: I'm in this exact bind right now as an artist and scientist. I have these cool electronics toys I've been prototyping and building at an enthusiast scale for some time now. I want to gift my designs to the world so that people can get joy from them. That is what I want. I'm not too concerned about making a bunch of money. What I am concerned about is some big corporation or schemy capitalist taking my work and abusing it for their gain. I'm currently searching for a license or patent I could use to prevent that from happening, but I really wish that wasn't necessary. I just want to share my art with the world without being taken advantage of.</p>

<p>Jerome Fenn: Also, about patents: A product I designed was straight-up stolen a while ago by a customer. He bought my product, liked it, and now he's making and selling the same product as his own. He already had a larger audience on social media, so he will most likely make more money selling my product than I ever will myself. Fine. He's still doing the work, so it's fair that he is compensated for his work. Except in this system, every item he sells is literally one less item I can sell, as I cannot afford to out-advertise him. 

Now, here's the thing: there is also nothing I can do about this because I could not afford to patent the product. IP law, in this case, was useless to me specifically because I am poor.</p>
