I proposed porting SerenityOS to an ARM or RISC-V SBC on freenode (#serenityos)

I offered the upcoming PicoRio SBC as a good target for riscv64. (https://riscv.org/blog/2020/11/picorio-the-raspberry-pi-like-small-board-computer-for-risc-v)

dandroid informed me of the newly announced BeagleV (https://beagleboard.org/beaglev)

I've decided to target qemu-system-riscv64 as a minimum viable product.

This means first learning how to boot in the simplest way possible within that context.

vboskiv gave me this (https://github.com/nickwanninger/chariot/blob/trunk/arch/riscv/ld/qemu-virt64-kernel.ld) in regards to making a multiboot header in riscv.

Trying to decide if I need to use U-Boot.
