<h5>My earliest memory</h5>
<p>I was a baby maybe 2 years old and in daycare. I have an image in my mind of my little chubby baby hand holding a big gray plastic toy train track.</p>
<p>In the daycare room at NASA daycare (was next to NASA campus with many NASA babies) there was a corner surrounded by the low shelves with seemed taller as a baby. In that corner there was a window and I have memories of the bright and powerful light emminating through. There was action figures from Jimmy Neutron including the fat kid (I believe Carl). At one point there was a glass object that got removed because it's refractions were a fire hazard being next to the bright sunlight.</p>
