When I was 13/14 I attended a private school which I stayed at for ~1-1.5 years.

There was a kid there, my age, who was into all types of bad stuff (drugs, girls, boys, etc)

At first he was friendly and made a sort of effort to befriend me, but I wasn't into it and he seemed like bad news.

I think we got the impression that he had experienced some abuse, but I'm not 100% sure on that, because you know, people start rumors for various reasons.

I would overhear him talking about doing things with people. Second hand, apparently he met them online or something like that.

There was one girl who was ugly and I didn't like her, but you could find him and her kissing in class until I believe the teacher got tired of it.

I would stay at the school late when no other school people were around and on one occasion I shared the room with him and another guy who didn't really fit any gender profile well. I'm not sure what was up with that guy.

Well the troubled kid said something like 'we can have sex in the bathroom' and the other kid was like 'really?'. He was like 'yeah, no one really cares'. Other kid was like 'what if (I) tell someone?'

I was visibly grossed out by this, so troubled kid said to me 'if you tell anyone I'll kill you'. I wasn't scared by this, but I also didn't care enough to tell anyone so that was that.

Now fast forward a couple of years to when I was about the turn 16. I come back to the school to meet new students and some old, but not troubled kid.

One of the new students was a girl. She was trashy and a bit ugly, but I grew to like her and we were the same age. Me and her went on a walk with a different kid I had known before.

We were enjoying ourselves and I had a hunch that trash girl knew troubled kid (troubled kid was social like that).

I made some sex jokes (like 16 year olds do) and got laughs from my audience of two. Things were going alright, so at the end I slipped in some dark humor about abusing little emo boys (troubled kid was a very self identified emo).

I did this only to draw emo/troubled kid out of hiding if he was listening and to troll a little bit while I was at it.

Two days later emo boy shows up. I arrive at class room and am quickly greeted by him in my face saying 'well I'm back from selling opiods in bumbfuck *flyover state*' or something like that. For context, his parents had sent him to military school.

I was a little intimidated by someone being so confrontation to my face. I took a small time to compose myself and shot back 'so are you better than?'. He pretended to be offended and left the room with trash girl right behind him.

I thought everything was cool. At that point I had mostly confirmed my suspicion that he was a toxic little rich kid brat. I wasn't ok with that, but I also wasn't personally bothered much at that point.

I didn't feel that he had given me strong reason to be threatended. He came off as a p*ssy to me and I didn't think that he was going to have a follow up to that confrontation.

But, he did. It was late and most of the school related people had left the building. I was doing my lab work there and minding my own business, when I entered the class room.

He and trash girl were there making some weird attempt at being romantic.

I walked in the room and my mind was occupied looking for my lab material. It took a second for me to see what was going on, but when I did I got out of there quickly because it felt like a trap.

I took some time to compose myself and think the situation out.

I was livid, 'not more of this sh*t coming from this brat' and 'how inappropriate and inconsiderate' besides, this girl seems alright.

Also, I wasn't sure of emo boys age and he looked older than he was. It seemed to be a disgusting situation involving at least one slimy person.

I marched back and was greeted by a locked door. There was a confrontation.

I was searching around the lab for a something I could use to break the glass, when she came and opened it slightly.

I came over to hear her say 'go away' But, I body slammed the door before she could close it.

There was a struggle that ended when emo boy said 'let him in' (Yes even more disgusting) When I got in there I told her 'he's manipulative'. He tried to defend himself in a slimy way, but all I did was smile at him and leave

I waited a few minutes by the entrance to the facility until a large industrial truck pulled up and a man walked out who I felt may be her father.

I greeted the man and ask him 'you have a daughter with blue hair?'

He said yes and I informed him that she is messing around with *** (emo boy).

I said that me and *** go a ways back and that he is trouble. He seemed hesitant and asked if *** was 19 yrs old.

I expressed that I wasn't sure but that there is a good chance that's the case.

I told him that I need to get inside before she saw me. He thanked me for telling him.

Let's say she was not happy about this and it turned out that *** was actually our age, which I forgot. (There was a different *19yr* old ***)

I tried to be nice and reach out to her after the fact but she took advantage of my good intentions and things did not end well between us.

*** was sent back to military school before I got the displeasure of seeing him again.

I still think about this interacting almost 3yrs later. It has sadly burned a spot into my brain.
